Project: Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data)Â¶

This is an analysis made for the project Investigate a Dataset. The dataset I chose for this analysis is TMDb data, which contains information about 10,000 movies collected fromThe Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The

We first import the required libraries for the analysis. Pandas is a Python data analysis and manipulation tool which will help us read the csv file and then proceed to analysis. Numpy is a Python library with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions which we gonna need during our research. We gonna need matplotlib in order to have good visualisations of our data. It is also improtant to import the magic function %inline just to be sure that our visualisations will show inline.
