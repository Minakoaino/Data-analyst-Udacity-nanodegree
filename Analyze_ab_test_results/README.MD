## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

This analysis was an analysis based on an A/B test of an e-commerce website. A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. The goal was to decide whether the E-commerce website should keep the old page or change to a new. We performed different types of analysis but the summary was that we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
